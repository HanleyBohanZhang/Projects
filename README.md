# Projects
## Introduction
* This Github page records data analysis project codes and reports participated in since 2021. Some are group projects and some are individual assignments in the University of Sydney.
* The main computer languages and databases included are: R, Python (Jupyter Notebook), PgAdmine (SQL) and Matlab
## Project Details
| Course code| Name of Project | Language | Description | Personal Contribution | time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engg1801: Engineering Computing | Computer Lab test | Matlab | Basic computing and video creation through Matlab | Scientific computing, drawing 3D images, creating videos of balls bouncing | Feburary 2021 |
| Data1001: Foundations of Data Science | BMI Survey Based on Sleep Quality | R | This study is aimed to explore the influence of daily routines on body mass index (BMI) through linera regression moedl base on survey data. The main discovers are: first, participants sleep late overall and have problems with their sleep status. Second, the shorter sleep duration, the higher BMI. Third, weight is proportional to BMI. | Write the data analysis coding and create the presentation slides. | April 2021 |
| Data2002: Data Analytics: Learning from Data | Identifying Risk Factors Responsible for Differences in Birth Weight | R | This study is aimed to investigate how the mother’s health state influences the infant birth weight through developing a multiple linear regression model for prediction. The final model is formulated by applying the Akaike Information Criterion(AIC) and manually removing inappropriate predictors based on justifying the significance level. Results illustrate that the higher mothers’ last menstrual weight aided in the increase in birth weight. However, non-white race, uterine irritation, smoking, and hypertension can cause a decreasing impact on birth weight, which is consistent with prior research. The adjusted r-squared of the final model is 0.195 which reflects that the goodness- of-fit in the regression model may not be as expected, also suggesting a limited extent in explaining the total variance of observed birth weight. | Assumption check of multiple linear regression model

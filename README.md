# Projects
## Introduction
* This Github page records data analysis project codes and reports participated in since 2021. Some are group projects and some are individual assignments in the University of Sydney.
* The main computer languages and databases included are: R, Python (Jupyter Notebook), PgAdmine (SQL) and Matlab

## Project Details

*  **Engg1801: Engineering Computing - Computer Lab test**
  * Individual work
  * **Programming language:** Matlab 
  * **Description:** Basic computing and video creation through Matlab
  * **Personal Contribution:** Scientific computing, drawing 3D images, creating videos of balls bouncing
  * [Bouncing Ball movie Matlab cod file](https://github.com/HanleyBohanZhang/Projects/blob/main/2021S1IntensiveEngg1801/bouncingBallMovie.m)
  * **Time:** Feburary 2021
 
* **Data1001: Foundations of Data Science Group Project -  BMI Survey Based on Sleep Quality**
  * 4 person group project
  * **Programming language:** R
  * **Description:** This study is aimed to explore the influence of daily routines on body mass index (BMI) through linera regression moedl base on survey data. The main discovers are: first, participants sleep late overall and have problems with their sleep status. Second, the shorter sleep duration, the higher BMI. Third, weight is proportional to BMI. 
  * **Personal Contribution:** Initially analyse the data, data preprocessing including data cleaning; visualise the data and create the presentation slides.

* **Data2002: Data Analytics: Learning from Data - Identifying Risk Factors Responsible for Differences in Birth Weight**
  * 5 person group project
  * **Programming language:** R
  * **Description:** This study is aimed to investigate how the mother’s health state influences the infant birth weight through developing a multiple linear regression model for prediction. The final model is formulated by applying the Akaike Information Criterion(AIC) and manually removing inappropriate predictors based on justifying the significance level. Results illustrate that the higher mothers’ last menstrual weight aided in the increase in birth weight. The adjusted r-squared of the final model is 0.195 which reflects that the goodness- of-fit in the regression model may not be as expected, also suggesting a limited extent in explaining the total variance of observed birth weight.
  * **Personal Contribution:** Check the assumption of multiple linear regression; formulate the model using Akaike Information Criterion(AIC); write and format the report.
  * [Report R markdown code file](https://github.com/HanleyBohanZhang/Projects/blob/main/2021S2Data2002/exec_summary_final_V2.Rmd)
  * [Report pdf](https://github.com/HanleyBohanZhang/Projects/blob/main/2021S2Data2002/exec_summary_final_V2.pdf)
  * Time: July 2021


* **Data2001: Data Science, Big Data and Data Variety Group Project - Sydney Liveability Analysis**
  * 2 person group project
  * **Programming language:** Python (Jupyter notebook)
  * Description: This study is aimed to investigate the liveability for each suburb in SA2(Greate Sydney) area through computing liveability score by the Sigmoid function of z-score using multiple datasets such as census- based data and geospatial data. The final liveability score yields by calculating z-score for five dimensions of school catchments, accom- modation and food service facilities, retail service facilities, crime frequency and health services.
  * Personal Contribution: Connect database (PgAdmine) with Jupyter notebook; Merge multi-formating data set including csv dataset, geometric dataset and json semi-structure dataset; Write the final report 
  * [Data Analysis Jupyter Notebook code file](https://github.com/HanleyBohanZhang/Projects/blob/main/2022S1Data2001/data2001%20final.ipynb)
  * [Report pdf](https://github.com/HanleyBohanZhang/Projects/blob/main/2022S1Data2001/Sydney%20Liveability%20Analysis%20Assignment.pdf)
  * Time: May 2022

* **Data3406: Human-in-the-loop Data Science -  Analyse the Personal Step Trends across Week**
  * 3 person group project
  * **Programming language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * Description: This study aims to explore the individual's activity trends across the week (such as weekdays versus weekends) through step count data collecting from Apple health during 2022. We explore the trends across the week based on specific details: difference trend between weekday & weekend, step intensity pattern and adherence measures for one participant.
  * Personal Contribution: Ethical analysis; Background research; Initial Data Analysis including plot and analyse the histgram and grouped box plot; identify the average hourly step trend across Workday and Weekend through line chart ; stakeholder analysis and limitation discussion 
  * [Product Notebook](https://github.com/HanleyBohanZhang/Projects/blob/main/2022S2Data3406/Product_Notebook_Final_Version.ipynb)
  * Time: October 2022
